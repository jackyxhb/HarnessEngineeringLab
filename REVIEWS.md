# HELab Reviews

Canonical machine-readable review ledger for HELab's review-required surfaces.

- **Purpose:** Provide the self-hosted audit trail required by P2-3 generator/evaluator separation.
- **Approving identities must differ:** `generator` and `reviewer` cannot be the same string.
- **Scope rule:** Every approving record must list the reviewed files or directories in `scope_paths`.
- **Required by gate:** If a review-required surface changes, update this file before merge.
